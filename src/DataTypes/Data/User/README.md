## Message data type typing
### Fields
- _id: the UserID,
- nickName: the short name of user or just any name we want to show in chats
- password: the UserPassword
- chats: chats where user can write/read messages

## PS

### Why MessageData is Object
I used this structure `cause in future we will want to add another data to the MessageData like files and photos
